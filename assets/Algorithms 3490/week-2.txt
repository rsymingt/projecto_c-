Analysis of recursive algorithms
	n = input size
	identify basic operation
	check if basic operation varies depending on input size
	set up recurrence relation
	solve recurrence relation

Recurrence function
	function which the answer is based upon itself
	f(n) = f(n-1) + 1, n >= 1;
	n = 1, n == 0;
