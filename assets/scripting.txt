-a	Variable is an array.
-f	Use function names only.

-p	Display the attributes and values of each variable. When -p is used, additional options are ignored.
-r	Make variables read-only. These variables cannot then be assigned values by subsequent assignment statements, nor can they be unset.
-t	Give each variable the trace attribute.
-x	Mark each variable for export to subsequent commands via the environment.
