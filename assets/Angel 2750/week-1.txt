	Learning php, mySQL, javascript, CSS & HTML5, by Robin Nixon, OReilly Media

Assignment 1
	takes another prog as input and converts to c program
	spaces, carriage returns, tabs, commas, semicolon, curly braces, brackets
	open file, while loop reading one char at time, 
		if whitespace, \t, \n, \r then
			start new line
		if char is puncuation or bracket ,;(){} then
			print puncuation and new line
		else
			print characters without new line
	close file
	match keyword, var name (utility functions)

// ... \n
/* ... */

fgetc();
ungetc(); <-

Implementation characteristics
	unspecified behavior for something which the standard does not impose any requirements
	undefined behavior is something incorrect which the standard does not impose any requirements. anything may happen, from nothing, to a warning message, to program termination
	A constraint is a restriction or requirement that must be obeyed. if disobeyed program will become undefined
		problem with this definition is compiler only needs to output error message if both syntax and constraints are invalid
	Semantic Rules which are not explicitely stated and can be broken because the behavior is undefined the compiler doesn't have to issue a warning
	strictly conforming code is one which
		uses only specified features of language
		doesn't exceed any implementation-defined limits
		has no output that depends on implementation defined, unspecified, or undefined features
	Conforming program can depend on non-portable features
		conforming programs are considered with respect to a specific implementation and may be non-conforming using a different compiler
		compilers can have extensions, but not ones that alter behavior of strictly conforming program

Features of C11
	multithreading <threads.h> <stdatomic.h>
	array bounds checking

MIDTERM
int fn(a, b){
int a;
float b;
{
}

Code Rot
	program hasnt changed, yet stops working/compiling
		compiler, libraries, or OS upgraded
