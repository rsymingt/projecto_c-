Project Organization

- used to create avl based indexes on a file and search terms (delimted by spaces)
	in that file and print out the related paragraphs those keys were in
  
Ease of use
- can navigate through directories, create files (using nano), print files to console,
  make directories, and more. all done within the program
  
Commands
- for now typing 'help' within program lists commands, typing '-h' after command lists
  sub-commands. if it doesn't have a '-h' function it is a noraml UNIX command
